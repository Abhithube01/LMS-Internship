## Introduction

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for data visualization and machine learning. This project explores the dataset using various plots to visualize the relationships between different features.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (`Iris setosa`, `Iris versicolor`, and `Iris virginica`). Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals.

**Source**: The dataset is loaded directly from the Seaborn library.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
